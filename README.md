# Proxy Detection System

This project is a web-based Proxy Detection System built using **React.js** and **TensorFlow.js**. It is designed to identify proxy activities, such as impersonation or unauthorized access, in real-time. The system leverages machine learning models for detection and uses **Postman** for seamless integration of Python-based backend services with the React.js frontend.

## Features

- **Proxy Detection with TensorFlow.js**:
  - Uses TensorFlow.js for real-time analysis and detection.
  - ML models trained in Python are integrated via APIs.

- **React.js Frontend**:
  - User-friendly interface for interacting with the detection system.
  - Displays real-time results with intuitive visualizations.

- **Python Backend Integration**:
  - Python backend handles heavy computations and ML model execution.
  - APIs are tested and integrated using Postman for robust communication.

- **Real-Time Feedback**:
  - Immediate feedback on proxy activities.
  - Logs suspicious activities for review.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js**
- **TensorFlow.js**

### Backend
- **Python** (Flask/Django for API development)

### API Testing and Integration
- **Postman**

### Miscellaneous
- **Axios** for HTTP requests.
- **CSS/SCSS** for styling.

## Installation Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14+)
- Python (3.7+)
- Postman

### Frontend Dependencies
- React.js
- TensorFlow.js
- Axios

### Backend Dependencies
- Flask/Django
- TensorFlow

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
cd fast-api
```

### 2. Setting Up the Backend
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### 3. Setting Up the Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React.js development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### 4. API Testing with Postman
- Import the Postman collection from the `postman_collection.json` file in the repository.
- Test the backend APIs for functionality and correctness.
- Ensure endpoints are properly integrated with the React.js frontend.

## Usage

1. Launch the backend server and frontend React.js application.
2. Use the frontend interface to upload data or interact with the system.
3. Monitor real-time detection results and review logs for suspicious activities.
4. APIs tested via Postman can also be triggered directly for backend interactions.
